## Who in the Skibidi am I?
My name is *Awry*, I'm (almost) 22 and I study Computer Science in **Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology**.  
My pronouns are **Student/Debil** and I spend too much of my time in front of a computer.  
Sometimes I pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars.  
I could really use a wish rigth now, wish right now, wish right now.
